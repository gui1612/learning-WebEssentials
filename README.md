# Web Essentials Introduction

This is a small website project I made to self learn html and css basics. Since it was my first approach to these technologies and it is **totally not responsive** I decided not to host it and made it completelly just for fun and for learning purposes. Later, when I'm more experienced I'll make something more serious with a wider variety of tools.

For this project I only used Html and Css and made the templates from scratch

Even though it is not a serious project I plan to make further improvements before I'm finished with it:

### TODOS:

- [X] Fix the difference between pages footers
- [ ] Fix the weird interaction with the info button in the main page
- [ ] Take care of the page not rendering properly depending on the monitor sizw
- [ ] Prettify the borders in the projects page
- [ ] Make the ``onclick`` interactions on header links cleaner and smaller
- [ ] Make the website more interactive with javascript
- [ ] Write cleaner code

### Bonus:

- [ ] Create a contact page
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Make the sections of the main text expandable on click
