                    I'm currently taking a 5 years Integrated Masters Degree in Computer Science at Faculty of Engineering of U.Porto, 
                    I am always eager to learn more and more, to work on projects with other people and to be up to date with new 
                    technologies. I also enjoy being challenged and I hope I can develop a great mastery in my area of expertise 
                    along with some soft skills acquired on the course of it.

                    My main hobbies are running, programming and solving problems. I'm a tech enthusiast and my main area of
                    interest is backend programming, network and AI. I'm also a linux fan for as far as I remember. If you're 
                    interested have a lot at <a href="https://github.com/gui1612/dotfiles">my dotfilfes</a>

                    <b>About this website:</b> 
                    This website was made from scratch as a first approach to web development. Most likely I'll make a new version of
                    it using bootstrap. It was a fun experience nevertheless.
